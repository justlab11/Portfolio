        <h2>Portfolio Piece</h2>
        <p>
          This website is a great example of technical writing because of the layout and design of the website. It has separate sections for beginners and experts with different techniques for both.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website starts in a beginner-friendly way by showing the final product and discussing how easy the recipe is. Immediately after the introduction, the website starts the recipe for beginners. The website uses descriptions, pictures, short sentences, and notes to help the user complete the recipe. The recipe starts by laying out all of the ingredients, with a short description of each one’s purpose. This allows the user to make sure they have all of the ingredients and know why they need each ingredient. Each step has a short title that summarizes the section. These summaries explain what the user will be doing in each section. Each step also contains short sentences to keep the recipe easy to follow since there are fewer things to do in each step. At the end of each step, there is a picture of what the muffins should look like. This allows the user to compare their muffins with the muffins that the author has made to make sure that they are doing it correctly.

          Underneath the basic instructions is the actual recipe for the muffins. This recipe is meant for people who have experience cooking. The recipe uses short instructions, no pictures, and cooking vocabulary to present the information. Although the user is expected to have the experience, the user will not read instructions that are long and complex. Keeping the sentences short makes the recipe easier to understand. A more advanced cook would not need to see pictures of every step of the process. The user can keep going through the steps without constantly scrolling past images and other text. Using cooking vocabulary allows for the author to communicate the instructions more effectively. The author combines these ideas to create instructions like: “In a small bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together” (Sobjack). Every word in that step is relevant and describes what the user needs to do. All of these techniques are combined to create this technical document. These techniques make the document accessible to anyone, no matter their experience level.
