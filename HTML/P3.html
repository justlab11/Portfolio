          Reflect on the importance of document design.

          I consider document design to be one of the most important aspects of a document. Document design is essential in setting the tone of the document and engaging readers. Document design is the first thing a reader will notice when they see the document, so it is crucial to make the document look good to engage the reader. Some of the aspects that I try to incorporate in my documents are the font, font size, and whitespace.

          Picking a superb font helps the text fit the aesthetic of the webpage. If I am writing a business document, I will use one of the standard fonts, like Times New Roman or Arial, to give the document a professional tone. If I am making a resume or writing instructions, I use Helvetica with a larger font to make the document easy to see. The font sets the mood of the webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the font, I use the font size to differentiate between different parts of the document. The title usually has the largest font size and the regular-text has the smallest font. This helps to make the sections and subsections stand out against the regular-text and each other. The reader is much more likely to notice the sections if they are in a large font with bold lettering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another aspect of document design that I include is whitespace. I use a lot of whitespace in my documents; it makes the document look less cluttered and less daunting to read. When a reader is reading a document, and they see a wall of text, they are not going to feel motivated to continue reading. By using whitespace, the text will feel less claustrophobic and seem more appealing to read.
