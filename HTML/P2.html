          Pick the two most impactful techniques that are used to improve reading technical documents for nonspecialists. Since the reader is a nonspecialist, I believed more child-like techniques would make the technical documents easier to understand.

        <p>
          The two most effective techniques used to make technical material easier to understand for nonspecialists are providing illustrations and using comparisons to familiar things. Both of these techniques are effective because they can simplify a difficult task for nonspecialists.

          By using illustrations to show the material along with text to explain the material, the reader can visualize what they are reading. Nonspecialists have no background knowledge of the material so illustrations are even more important for them. If a nonspecialist is following an instruction manual, they would need images to see what they are expected to do, or what the outcome is supposed to look like; this allows for them to understand the directions even though they may not understand the terminology used in the instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using comparisons to familiar things, the reader can interpret difficult material quicker. If a technical document uses terminology that a nonspecialist is not familiar with then a nonspecialist would become confused as they read. The easiest way to solve this is to put the terminology into terms that a nonspecialist understands. This method of using comparisons allows nonspecialist readers to understand concepts that they are not familiar with.
