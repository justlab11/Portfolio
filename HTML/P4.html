        <h2>Prompt</h2>
        <p>
          This portfolio prompt examines the insight that I gained from a professional technical writer's lecture.

        <h2>Portfolio Piece</h2>
        <p>
          I came into the event wanting to know about the software she uses to make documents. She stated that she mostly works with Microsoft Word, but it is unusual to only work with Word in her field. This answer definitely diverged from what I had expected because I never considered Microsoft Word to be good enough for manuals. Word is great for business documents, but it is terrible for formatting manuals. Software like LaTeX is much more freely customizable, which is something that I expected her to mention.
        </p>

          The biggest mistake that I learned from the event was what she said about the point of view of a manual. She stated that the manual should always be in second person and should never change perspectives. This is an easy mistake to make and I will keep it in mind when I write my instruction manual.
        </p>

          A helpful tip that I would like to incorporate into my own writing more often is to use bulleted lists appropriately. She mentioned that using bulleted lists is a great way to make information easier to understand, but people tend to misuse them. I never use bulleted lists in my own writing, I usually use a series of commas to make lists, but I will try to use bulleted lists when necessary.
        </p>

          The most fascinating bit of insight I gained was on how she starts the writing process. She stated that she often starts a technical document with no prior knowledge on the subject. Before she can even write the manual, she has to learn the material. This is interesting to me because she starts off in the position of a nonspecialist. She has no experience with the technology and has to learn it. This puts her in an interesting position because she can write the manual in a way that she would have liked to see it.
