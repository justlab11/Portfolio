        <h2>Prompt</h2>
        <p>
          Write a technical description about an object that could be used to better understand life during COVID-19. For this prompt, I chose a face mask since it is the most used item for COVID-19 prevention.

        <h3>DISPOSABLE FACE MASKS</h3>
        <p>
          The best item used to protect people from COVID-19 is the face mask. COVID-19 is a virus that spreads through the air when a person talks or breathes. COVID-19 is a dangerous and infectious virus that can cause a multitude of deadly symptoms. Death is more likely for people with underlying health conditions, but healthy people have also died due to this disease. These face masks are used to limit the amount of particles that go into the air while talking or breathing. This document will discuss the design and purpose of these masks throughout the pandemic.

        <p>
          Disposable face masks are rectangular in shape with one elastic strap on the short sides of the rectangle. The elastic straps are wrapped around a person’s ears so that the mask stays in place for the duration of time that the person needs it. The masks also have folds across them to allow for them to reach from a person’s chin to their nose. These folds function similarly to an accordion’s folds so the masks can easily change in size. The masks have a nose clip on the top that can be pinched on the nose to fit better and closer to the user’s face. Within the masks are filters which allow for air to enter the mask and prevent particles from exiting the inside of the mask.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the masks is to slow the spread of COVID-19. Since this virus is so hazardous to humans, everyone is supposed to wear the masks to protect themselves and others. Due to the filtering from the masks, people continue to breathe in oxygen, but without the virus getting through. This safety net helps to lower the rate of infection. Since COVID-19 spreads easily, many hospitals are becoming overcrowded and temporary hospitals are being used. By lowering the rate of infection, hospitals will be able to operate at normal capacity. These masks have been used throughout the entire pandemic and will continue to be used until there is a vaccination for the virus.
