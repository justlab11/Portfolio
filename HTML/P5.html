        <h2>Prompt</h2>
        <p>
          Write a technical description about an object that could be used to better understand life during COVID-19. For this prompt, I chose a face mask since it is the most used item for COVID-19 prevention.

        <h3>DISPOSABLE FACE MASKS</h3>
        <p>
          The best item used to protect people from COVID-19 is the face mask. COVID-19 is a virus that spreads through the air when a person talks or breathes. COVID-19 is dangerous enough to cause massive amounts of hospital traffic. These face masks are a way to limit the amount of particles that go into the air while breathing. This document will discuss the design and purpose of these masks throughout the pandemic.

        <h4>Body</h4>
        <p>
          Disposable face masks are rectangular in shape with one elastic strap on the short sides of the rectangle. The elastic straps are wrapped around a person’s ears so that the mask stays in place for the duration of time that the person needs it. The masks also have folds across them to allow for them to reach from a person’s chin to their nose. These folds function similarly to an accordion’s folds so the masks can easily change in size. Within the masks are filters which allow for air to enter the mask and prevent particles from exiting the inside of the mask.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the masks is to slow the spread of COVID-19. Since this virus is so hazardous to humans, everyone is supposed to wear the masks to protect themselves and others. Due to the filtering from the masks, people continue to breathe in oxygen, but without the virus getting through. This safety net helps to lower the rate of infection which is crucial since hospitals are constantly becoming overcrowded. These masks have been used throughout the entire pandemic and will continue to be used until there is a vaccination for the virus.
