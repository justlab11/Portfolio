        <h2>Prompt</h2>
        <p>
          This portfolio prompt is the start of a cover letter that I could use in the future. I considered where I would like to work and what I would like to do.
        </p>

        <h2>Portfolio Piece</h2>
        <p>
          The field of electrical engineering relies heavily on math and coding, which are two hobbies of mine. I enjoy figuring out how the things we use in our daily lives are designed and all of the small, but important, elements that go into their design.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ideal career would consist of using hardware and software to solve complex tasks. Working with computers and using creativity to solve problems is something that I hope to do in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goals for my next job are to start my electrical engineering career and to apply the knowledge that I have been learning for the past four years. Since I have never had a job before, I am excited to enter into the field of electrical engineering and learn new things.
        </p>
        <p>
          To improve the likelihood of getting a job, my next step is to get an internship or do undergraduate research. I am currently discussing a potential research opportunity with Professor Brockmeier; he works with biomedical image classification and machine learning algorithms. After getting some experience in the field, the next step is to decide where in the world I would like to work. This step is the key to determining the job positions that will be available to me. After picking the location, I will have to start looking and applying for jobs. Once I get a job, I will have achieved all that I set out to accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a recent graduate of the University of Delaware, where I studied electrical engineering. I am passionate about this position because machine learning is something that I have taken the time to learn throughout college. I have worked with graduate students and professors to improve my machine learning abilities. I hope to apply what I have learned to real-world projects.
