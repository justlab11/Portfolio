        <h2>Portfolio Piece</h2>
        <p>
          This website is a great example of technical writing because it provides instructions in an easy to read format, making it accessible to most people. Since it is a recipe, it starts off by listing all of the required ingredients to make the muffins, which allows for the user to decide if this recipe is possible with what they have in their home. The website then goes step by step through the recipe and includes pictures to make following the directions even more straightforward. Using pictures improves how accessible the website is since the user can see what they should be doing and what the muffins should look like at every stage of the cooking process. Throughout these instructions, the author adds tips and important notes so that the user does not make any mistakes while cooking. Following these easy to follow instructions, the author lists the actual recipe for the muffins with a more compact set of directions. This allows someone with cooking experience to skip the amateurish instructions and go right into the cooking.
